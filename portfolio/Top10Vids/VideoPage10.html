        "Red, a bird with a short temper, is an outcast on Bird Island, an island containing a village inhabited by anthropomorphic, flightless birds. When he accidentally causes a premature hatching of a bird family's egg, he is sentenced to anger management class, the highest penalty allowed on the island. Two of Red's classmates—Chuck, who is hyperactive and can move at hypervelocity, and Bomb, who can cause explosions with his anger and fear—try to befriend him, but he avoids them." </p>
